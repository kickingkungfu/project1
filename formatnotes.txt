notes for how to set up the data types so that they are all referenced in the tile format.

the set may be useful to set up the initial tile for inquiries
	within the set there will be dictionaries tied to the various components of the books
	the set will be able to pull any information from the components entered into it
	potentially each component of the selected set will spawn new components that will provide a means of investigating the subject further
		function needed to iterate over all of the components
	various components may need to be made into classes
		class Book:
			def __init__(category, x, y):
				category.x = x
				category.y = y

		p = Book(Mystery, fiction)
			print(p.x)
			print(p.y)
